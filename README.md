# LUJS
### A simple Node server project for emulating LEGO Universe servers (or anything that uses RakNet of this version)

I do not (and probably will not) offer support for this. If it gets to the point where I can log in and load a world, I may just stop developing. And leave this up for others to work with.

## Setup

To get it running, download the repository, initialize Node, and it is ready to go!

## Contributing

I don't plan on anyone else taking interest in this, but if you do, feel free to fork this repository and give it a merge request. I will be happy to look at another person's code if they want to add to this.

## Other notes

I might add more documentation later
